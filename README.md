# College Broadcast Notification System ðŸ“¢

A simple web application built with Flask that allows a college administrator to send bulk announcements to parents. The system uses CSV files to manage parent contact information and allows for flexible filtering by academic year and department.

## Features âœ¨

- **Secure Admin Login**: A dedicated login page protects the dashboard from unauthorized access.
- **Protected Dashboard**: Only logged-in users can view the dashboard and use the broadcasting features.
- **Flexible Filtering**: Send messages to all parents, or filter recipients by:
  - A specific academic year (e.g., 1st Year only).
  - A specific department (e.g., CSE only).
  - A combination of both (e.g., 1st Year CSE students).
- **CSV Data Management**: Parent contact information is managed through simple, easy-to-edit CSV files organized by year.
- **Broadcast Simulation**: The core logic for gathering recipients is fully functional, with the output printed to the terminal for testing before integrating a live SMS gateway.
